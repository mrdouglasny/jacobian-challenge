# R7 — the germ→coefficient descent: `resFunctional` becomes a functional on `cechH1 K`

The descent rung of the fine-sheaf residue ladder (`docs/planning/R6_HANDOFF.md`, "the prize
lap"): connect the **germ-level** Čech complex of the port (`CechComplex.lean`: cochains are
codiscrete germ classes `MGerm`, `cechH1 K = Z¹/B¹` via `submoduleOf`) to the **chart-coefficient**
fine-sheaf residue engine (lanes R0–R5: `resFunctional`, `glueCoeff`,
`resFunctional_eq_zero_of_coboundary`), producing the `resCocycle`/`vanish_coboundary` fields of
the port's isolated Cousin interface `CousinResidueData` (`GlobalResidueConstruct.lean`).

## The three layers

* **Extraction (`cocycleFn`).** A 1-cocycle `c ∈ Z¹(𝒪_K)` on the chart-disk cover assigns to each
  overlap a *codiscrete germ class*; raw representatives carry removable-singularity junk, so the
  extraction goes through the proven `holoFn` limit-repair (`HoloRep.lean`), which returns the
  honest analytic representative.  This needs the overlap germs to be `𝒪`-classes
  (`OmegaDGerm 0`), which holds when no pole of `K` lies on an overlap — the **K-point refinement
  discipline** of `Glue.lean`/`OmegaWitness.lean`, packaged here as `SeparatesPoles 𝔇 K` (poles
  of `K` lie in single cover sets).  Diagonal pairs get the zero function (the cocycle identity
  forces the diagonal germ to vanish).  The extracted family satisfies `SmoothOnOverlaps`,
  `IsOverlapCocycle`, `HolomorphicOnOverlaps`, so `glueCoeff 𝔇 (cocycleFn …) g ∈ oneOneCoeff 𝔇`
  by the R3 glue law, and `resFunctional` applies.

* **Linearity & well-definedness (`resCocycle`).** Different germ representatives agree
  *pointwise on the overlaps* (codiscrete agreement + continuity of the analytic representatives,
  `eq_at_of_toGerm_eq`), and `resFunctional ∘ glueCoeff` only ever reads overlap values
  (`resFunctional_congr_chartImage`), so `c ↦ resFunctional (glueCoeff (cocycleFn c) g)` is a
  ℂ-**linear** functional on `Z¹(𝒪_K)` — the `resCocycle` field.

* **Coboundary vanishing & the liftQ descent.** For a coboundary `δ⁰f` with `f` a 0-cochain of
  `𝒪`-classes (`sections0 0`), the extracted data is exactly the `(w, h)`-shape of R5's
  `resFunctional_eq_zero_of_coboundary`, so the functional kills it
  (`resCocycle_eq_zero_of_holomorphic_coboundary`).  When `K ≤ 0` (in particular `K = 0`, the
  genus-1 canonical divisor) **every** coboundary is of this shape, giving the full
  `vanish_coboundary` field (`resCocycle_vanish_coboundary_of_nonpos`) and hence the descended
  functional on `cechH1 K` (`Submodule.liftQ`, exactly the port's `CousinResidueData.res`
  packaging).  For `K > 0` somewhere (genus ≥ 2), coboundary 0-cochains of `𝒪_K` carry *scalar*
  poles at the K-points (the forms `h·ω₀` are holomorphic, the scalars are not), and their
  vanishing is the residue-theorem leg that needs the (higher-order) Mittag–Leffler tie — a
  genuine R6-class gap, taken as a hypothesis here and recorded in
  `docs/planning/R7_BLOCKER.md`.

## Conditionality on R6 (in flight, separate branch)

`MLTie.lean` is being finished in parallel and is **not imported**.  Its outputs are packaged as
the hypothesis structure `R6Outputs`, whose fields copy the statement shapes of the in-flight
`resFunctional_mlGlue` / `resFunctional_mlCocycle_residue_one` *verbatim* (over local copies of
the ML-datum definitions in the `R6Shape` namespace, same orientation contract
`w i j = p_i − p_j`).  When R6 lands, `R6Outputs` is inhabited by a two-line bridge.  The final
assembly `cousinResidueData_of_descent` builds the port's `CousinResidueData 𝔇.toFiniteCover K`
from the proven `resCocycle` plus the two named open legs (`hvanish`, `hnondeg`).

`MGerm` identifies functions agreeing off a discrete set.  On a Riemann surface no point is
isolated (`nhdsNE_neBot`), so two representatives that are *continuous* at a point of the open
agree **at** the point: codiscrete agreement gives punctured-neighbourhood agreement, and both
values are the (unique) limits. -/
