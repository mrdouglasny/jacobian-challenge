`HolomorphicOneForm X` — holomorphic 1-forms on a complex 1-manifold `X`.

At the pinned Mathlib commit there is no cotangent-bundle API for complex
manifolds (nor a general `ContMDiff` section API that applies, since the
cotangent bundle isn't constructed). We therefore use the chart-cocycle
formulation per `docs/formalization-plan.md` §4.1 fallback path.

A holomorphic 1-form is specified by a chart-local coefficient
`coeff : X → ℂ → ℂ` (first argument: the centre point of the chart;
second: the coordinate in that chart's target) satisfying:

1. **Chart-local holomorphicity** (`IsHolomorphicOneFormCoeff`): for
   each `x : X`, the function `coeff x : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic on
   `(extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).target`.
2. **Cotangent cocycle** (`SatisfiesCotangentCocycle`): on chart
   overlaps, the coefficient values transform via the derivative of the
   chart transition:
       coeff x z  =  coeff y (φ_y(φ_x⁻¹(z))) · D(φ_y ∘ φ_x⁻¹)(z)(1)
   (the classical 1-form transformation law).

## Current status (2026-04-23)

**Real definition**, not a stub. `HolomorphicOneForm X` is the
ℂ-submodule of `X → ℂ → ℂ` cut out by the two predicates above, with
`zero_mem' / add_mem' / smul_mem'` discharged.

The earlier history note about a `⊥`-stub refers to iterations before
the 2026-04-23 refactor. The carrier history:
  1. `{f | True ∧ True}` (≅ full function space): with
     `AX_FiniteDimOneForms` installed, gave an `exploit ⇒ False` via
     `rank_fun_infinite`. Caught by Gemini 2026-04-22.
  2. `⊥` (zero submodule): safe but vacuous — `genus X = 0` always.
  3. (**Current**) Real predicates with analyticity + cocycle. The
     `AX_FiniteDimOneForms` instance is load-bearing and finite-dim
     follows classically (Hodge / Serre duality — see
     `Jacobians/Axioms/FiniteDimOneForms.lean`).

## API available here

- `coeff form : X → ℂ → ℂ` — chart-local coefficient accessor.
- `coeff_zero` / `coeff_add` / `coeff_smul` — `@[simp]` compatibility
  with the `AddCommGroup` / `Module ℂ` structure (via `Submodule`).
- `ext_of_coeff` — two forms are equal if their coefficient families
  agree as functions.

See also:
  - `Jacobians/Axioms/FiniteDimOneForms.lean` — finite-dim axiom (classical theorem, still load-bearing).
  - `Jacobians/ProjectiveCurve/Line/OneForm.lean` — derived fact that `HolomorphicOneForm ProjectiveLine` is a subsingleton (genus-0 collapse).
  - `Jacobians/ProjectiveCurve/Elliptic/OneForm.lean` — explicit `ellipticDz` witness (invariant 1-form `dz`).

`docs/formalization-plan.md` §4.1 and `docs/gemini-review-axioms.md`
have further context.

coefficients `coeff : X → ℂ → ℂ` is holomorphic on each chart target."

For each point `x : X`, the function `coeff x : ℂ → ℂ` should be
holomorphic on the image of the chart at `x`, i.e. on
`(extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).target`. -/

compatibility condition holds on chart overlaps."

For two points `x y : X` and `z ∈ (extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).target` such that
the back-image `(extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).symm z` lies in the source of the
chart at `y`, the coefficient values in the two charts must be related
by the derivative of the chart transition:

    coeff x z  =  coeff y w · D(φ_y ∘ φ_x⁻¹)(z) · 1

where `w := (extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) y) ((extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).symm z)` is the
`y`-chart coordinate of the same point. This is the classical
transformation law for a 1-form `ω = coeff x · dφ_x = coeff y · dφ_y`,
written intrinsically via the derivative `D(φ_y ∘ φ_x⁻¹)(z)` of the
chart transition map. -/

/-- **Predicate (added 2026-04-24).** "The coefficient family is zero
off each chart target."

For each `x : X`, the function `coeff x : ℂ → ℂ` is required to be
zero outside `(extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ) x).target`. This normalisation eliminates
off-target ambiguity in the submodule representation: two coefficient
families agreeing on all chart targets are then equal as functions
`X → ℂ → ℂ`, so `HolomorphicOneForm.ext_of_coeff` gives the correct
extensionality. Without this, the submodule would contain functions
differing only off-target — which would be an infinite-dimensional
degree of freedom inconsistent with `AX_FiniteDimOneForms`. -/

/-- The ℂ-submodule of `X → ℂ → ℂ` consisting of chart-local coefficient
families representing holomorphic 1-forms on `X`.

Closed under addition and scalar multiplication: analyticity is closed
under sums/smul (Mathlib `AnalyticOn.add`, `AnalyticOn.const_smul`); the
cocycle is ℂ-linear in the coefficient family because `fderiv` is
ℂ-linear; off-target zero is trivially preserved under linearity. -/
