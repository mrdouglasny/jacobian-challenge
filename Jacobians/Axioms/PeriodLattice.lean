`AX_PeriodLattice`: the period image in basis coordinates is a full
`ℤ`-lattice in `ℂ^g`.

## Construction-level setup

`periodMap X x₀` currently lands in `(HolomorphicOneForm X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ)`. The
Jacobian bridge in `Jacobians/Jacobian/Construction.lean` needs a lattice
inside the concrete ambient `Fin (genus X) → ℂ`, because
`ComplexTorus.lean` is already built over explicit finite-dimensional
normed complex vector spaces.

So this file fixes a basis

* `b : Module.Basis (Fin (genus X)) ℂ (HolomorphicOneForm X)`

and transports the period map into coordinates:

* `periodMapInBasis X x₀ b : H1 X x₀ →ₗ[ℤ] (Fin (genus X) → ℂ)`.

Its range `periodLatticeInBasis X x₀ b` is the lattice used by the
bridge construction.

## Why axiomatized

The classical theorem is that the period image is discrete of full real
rank. Equivalently, in any holomorphic-one-form basis it is a full
`ℤ`-lattice in `ℂ^g`. This follows from the Riemann bilinear relations;
see Mumford, *Tata Lectures on Theta I*, Ch. II §2, and Griffiths-Harris,
Ch. 2 §2.

At the current project stage the actual proof depends on path integrals,
the intersection form, and the positive-definiteness statement packaged in
`AX_RiemannBilinear`, so we expose the lattice property here as a named
axiom for the Jacobian bridge.

Both axioms below are **NOT VERIFIED** and should be retired once the
Riemann-bilinear infrastructure lands.

/-- **Axiom (NOT VERIFIED).** In basis coordinates, the period image carries
the discrete topology.

This is one half of the data required by Mathlib's `IsZLattice`-based
`ComplexTorus` API. It should eventually be derived from
`AX_RiemannBilinear`, since a full lattice in a finite-dimensional real
vector space is automatically discrete. -/

Mathematical source: the classical period-lattice theorem, equivalently the
combination of Riemann's bilinear relations with the rank computation
`rank H₁(X, ℤ) = 2g`. This is the exact hypothesis needed to feed the
period image into `AbelianVariety.ComplexTorus`. -/
