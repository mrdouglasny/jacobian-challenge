# The arithmetic-genus atom is cover-free: `h¹(𝒪)` transfer via the Dolbeault comparison

The `g = 0` keystone leg (`SerreDualityGenus0`) is reduced to the single scalar atom
`hga : 𝔘.h1Dim 0 = 0` — but stated at a *given* cover `𝔘`, while the keystone's ∃-cover
weakening and the R-lane capstone (`exists_separating_cousinResidueData`) each choose their
*own* chart-disk cover.  This file removes the cover dependence:

The `IsLeray`-free Čech↔Dolbeault comparison (`GoodCover.cechH1_dolbeault_comparison'`)
pins `finrank ℝ (DolbeaultH01 X) = 2 · finrank ℂ (cechH1 𝔇 0)` for EVERY chart-disk cover
`𝔇` — the left side is cover-free, so `h¹(𝔇, 𝒪) = h¹(𝔇', 𝒪)` for any two chart-disk covers
(`h1Dim_zero_chartDiskCover_invariant`), and the atom proven at ANY one of them (e.g. the
canonical `chartDiskCover`) feeds ALL of them (`hga_transfer` /
`h1Dim_zero_eq_canonical`).

**What this file does NOT do**: prove the atom itself.  `h1Dim 0 = 0` at `kirovGenus X = 0`
remains the genuine analytic wall (`G0_BLOCKER.md`: needs `H^{0,1} = 0` from the absence of
holomorphic 1-forms — Hodge-flavoured — or the meromorphic-`ω₀'` residue route).  What is
banked is that the wall need only be climbed ONCE, at whichever cover is most convenient.

## Main declarations

* `h1Dim_zero_chartDiskCover_invariant` — `h¹(𝒪)` agrees on all chart-disk covers.
* `hga_transfer` — the genus-0 atom transfers between chart-disk covers.
* `h1Dim_zero_eq_canonical` — every chart-disk cover's `h¹(𝒪)` equals the canonical one's.
