# R5a — the planar Stokes atom and the `∂̄`-packaging of the chart-pushed PoU weight

First half of lane-R rung R5 (S3 scoping §4.R5, `docs/planning/S3_FINESHEAF_RES_SCOPING.md`;
campaign `docs/planning/CAMPAIGN_KEYSTONE.md`).  Two independent deliverables:

1. **The planar Stokes atom** (`integral_dbar_eq_zero`):

     `∫_ℂ ∂̄g dA = 0`  for `g` smooth with compact support.

   This is the only genuinely *integral* input of the coboundary-vanishing assembly (R5b,
   `CoboundaryVanish.lean`): on a compact surface `∬_X ∂̄β = 0`, and in the chart-coefficient
   representation every global term is a compactly supported planar function, so the surface
   Stokes reduces to the planar one.  Route: `∂̄ = ½(∂ₓ + i·∂_y)` is a fixed combination of two
   directional derivatives, and `∫_ℂ ∂_v g = 0` for each direction `v` is integration by parts
   against the constant `1` (`integral_mul_fderiv_eq_neg_fderiv_mul_of_integrable`, the Fubini +
   line-FTC content prepackaged in Mathlib; the same divergence-theorem layer as the port's
   `greenOnUnitBox` precedent, with no boundary term because the support is compact).

2. **The `∂̄`-packaging of `pouCoeff`** — the gap flagged in the R4 handoff: R4 proved
   `contDiff_pouCoeff` but never computed its `∂̄`.  The two-case pattern of `contDiff_pouCoeff`
   yields the chart read of `∂̄ρ_j` (the manifold-level `dbarRho` of the backbone) through the
   indicator:

   * `dbar_pouCoeff_chartRead` — on the chart image of `U j`, `∂̄ρ̃_j` is the `∂̄` of the honest
     chart read `ρ_j ∘ (chart j).symm` (the indicator only removes zeros);
   * `dbar_pouCoeff_eq_zero_of_notMem_image_tsupport` — off the (compact) chart image of
     `tsupport ρ_j`, `∂̄ρ̃_j = 0` (the frontier case, killed by the compact-tsupport clearance).

   Plus the PoU-reinsertion identity `sum_dbar_rhoC_read` — the chart-read form of the backbone's
   `sum_dbarRho_eq_zero`: at any point of a chart target, `∑_j ∂̄(ρ_j ∘ (chart k).symm) = 0`,
   because `∑_j ρ_j = 1` *globally* (`sum_rhoC_apply`), so the sum of the reads is the constant
   `1`.  This is what kills the relocated `∑_j (∂̄ρ̃_j)·β_j` sum in R5b.

Supporting planar `∂̄`-calculus (`dbar_congr_of_eventuallyEq`, `dbar_eq_zero_of_eventuallyEq_zero`,
`dbar_finset_sum`) and the two-case globalization helpers (`contDiff_of_chartImage_clearance`,
`contDiff_pouCoeff_mul`) used throughout R5b's integrability bookkeeping.

The sign/normalization convention remains the **pinned** R0 gate (`SignTest.lean`):
`resNormalization = −π⁻¹` on Lebesgue-area integrals of `(1,1)` chart coefficients — cited,
never re-derived; nothing in this file touches it (the Stokes atom is normalization-free:
its right-hand side is `0`).
