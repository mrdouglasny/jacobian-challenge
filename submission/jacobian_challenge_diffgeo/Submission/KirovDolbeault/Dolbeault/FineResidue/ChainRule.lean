# R3a — the planar Wirtinger chain rule for `∂̄` along a holomorphic map

Lane R rung R3, first half (S3 scoping §4.R3, `docs/planning/S3_FINESHEAF_RES_SCOPING.md`;
campaign `docs/planning/CAMPAIGN_KEYSTONE.md`).  Completes the planar `∂̄` calculus started by
the R0 Leibniz rule `dbar_mul`: this file adds the composition law

  `∂̄(f ∘ φ)(z) = ∂̄f(φ z) · conj φ′(z)`   (`dbar_comp`)

for `φ` holomorphic at `z` and `f` merely `ℝ`-differentiable at `φ z`.

Placement: a separate file rather than an extension of `SignTest.lean`, because `SignTest` is the
frozen R0 sign/normalization **gate** ("cite this, do not re-derive") — R3 calculus layers on top
of it without touching the pinned conventions.  Importing `SignTest` keeps the planar `∂̄`
calculus (`dbar_mul` → `dbar_comp`) linearly ordered for downstream consumers (Glue, R4–R6).

## Why `conj φ′`

`∂̄` is the `dz̄`-component of the real differential.  Precomposition with a holomorphic `φ`
pulls `dz̄` back to `conj φ′ · dz̄`, so `∂̄` of a chart-read function transforms across a
holomorphic transition as a **(0,1)** chart coefficient — factor `conj φ′` exactly.  The
companion factor `φ′` of the `(1,1)` law `OneOneLawAt` (R1) is *not* produced by this chain
rule: it comes from the holomorphic change of the `dz`-slot (the `(1,0)` coefficient family of
`Glue.lean`), and `φ′ · conj φ′ = normSq φ′` reassembles R1's factor.

Proof shape: `fderiv_comp`, plus the fact that the real Fréchet derivative of a holomorphic map
is complex multiplication by `φ′(z)` (`HasDerivAt.complexToReal_fderiv` — the same atom
`DbarDisk.dbar_eq_zero_of_differentiableAt` is built on); the Wirtinger combination
`½(D 1 + i·D i)` is then evaluated by decomposing the (only `ℝ`-linear!) derivative `D` of `f`
over the real basis `1, i`.

/-- **Planar Wirtinger chain rule.**  If `φ` is holomorphic at `z` and `f` is (merely)
`ℝ`-differentiable at `φ z`, then

  `∂̄(f ∘ φ)(z) = ∂̄f(φ z) · conj φ′(z)`.

Precomposition with a holomorphic map transforms `∂̄` by the **anti-holomorphic** derivative
factor `conj φ′` — the `(0,1)` (`dz̄`-slot) covariance.  Composition counterpart of the R0
Leibniz rule `dbar_mul`; the analytic half of the `(1,1)` glue law (`Glue.lean`). -/
