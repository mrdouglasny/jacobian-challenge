# R2 — the partition-of-unity split of an overlap cocycle

Step 2 of the Forster §17.3 fine-sheaf residue construction (S3 scoping §2.0–2.1, lane R):
given a chart-disk cover and a family of overlap functions `w i j` (holomorphic cocycle values —
what a Mittag–Leffler datum contributes as `w i j = m j − m i`, and what R1's germ→coefficient
extraction will produce from a Čech cocycle in `Z¹(𝒪_K)` via `ω₀·`), the smooth partition of
unity glues the *local* overlap data into per-chart split functions

  `σ_i := ∑_k ρ_k · w k i`,

smooth on `U i` (`contMDiffAt_pouSplit` — the support-aware `gdTerm` gluing pattern), with the
telescoping identity

  `σ_j − σ_i = w i j` on `U i ⊓ U j`  (`pouSplit_telescope`),

so the Čech cocycle becomes a coboundary of the smooth `0`-cochain `σ` — the input to R3's
`τ_i := ∂̄σ_i` (which the telescoping makes well-glued, since `∂̄w_{ij} = 0`).

Everything is **reused** from the proven `DolbeaultComparisonInverse` backbone: the fixed
subordinate PoU `cechPoU` (from `SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate` through the
`RealManifold` bridge), its complexification `rhoC`, the normalizations `sum_rhoC_apply` /
`cechPoU_subordinate`.  The telescoping here is the *support-aware* refinement of the abstract
`cechCoboundary_telescoping`: the cocycle identity is only demanded on **triple overlaps**
(`IsOverlapCocycle`), because the weight `ρ_k` kills every summand whose index leaves its cover
set — this is what lets Mittag–Leffler/Čech data, which carry no information outside the
overlaps, feed the split.

Hypotheses are stated pointwise-on-overlaps (membership-guarded), matching the germ-eventual
discipline of R1 (`OneOneCoeff.lean`): only values on the (open) overlaps are ever consumed.

/-! ### The overlap-family interface -/

/-- An overlap family `w` is **smooth on overlaps** when each `w i j` is `C^∞` (over `ℝ`, the
`ContMDiffAt 𝓘(ℝ, ℂ)` of the port's form calculus) at every point of `U i ⊓ U j`.  Values
outside the overlap are junk and never consumed (the `gdTerm`/`diskVal` global-stand-in
idiom). -/

    ContMDiffAt 𝓘(ℝ, ℂ) 𝓘(ℝ, ℂ) (⊤ : ℕ∞) (w i j) x

/-- An overlap family `w` is an **overlap cocycle** when the additive Čech cocycle identity
`w b c − w a c + w a b = 0` holds pointwise on every **triple** overlap — the only place the
PoU split ever reads it.  This is the value-level shadow of `cechDelta1 = 0`. -/
def IsOverlapCocycle (w : 𝔇.toFiniteCover.ι → 𝔇.toFiniteCover.ι → X → ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a b c, ∀ x ∈ (𝔇.U a ⊓ 𝔇.U b ⊓ 𝔇.U c : Opens X),
    w b c x - w a c x + w a b x = 0

/-- **Difference families are overlap cocycles** — the Mittag–Leffler shape: for any value
family `v` (e.g. the local lifts `m_i` of an ML datum, or the disk primitives `diskVal`), the
overlap family `w i j := v j − v i` satisfies the cocycle identity identically. -/

/-! ### The PoU split and its smoothness -/

/-- The **partition-of-unity split** of an overlap family: `σ_i := ∑_k ρ_k · w k i`, with
`ρ = cechPoU 𝔇` the fixed subordinate smooth PoU of the inverse-comparison backbone.  A global
stand-in function, meaningful (and smooth) on `U i`. -/

/-- **Smoothness of the split on its own cover set** (the `gdTerm` support-aware gluing): at
`x ∈ U i`, every summand `ρ_k · w k i` is smooth — on `tsupport ρ_k` because subordination puts
`x` in `U k ⊓ U i` where `w k i` is smooth, off it because the summand vanishes on a
neighbourhood. -/

/-! ### The telescoping identity -/

/-- **The telescoping identity of the PoU split**: on `U i ⊓ U j`,

  `σ_j − σ_i = w i j`.

Support-aware refinement of `cechCoboundary_telescoping`: termwise, either `ρ_k x = 0` (and the
`k`-summand contributes nothing), or subordination places `x` in the triple overlap
`U k ⊓ U i ⊓ U j` where the cocycle identity converts `w k j − w k i` into `w i j`; summing the
weights with `∑_k ρ_k x = 1` finishes.  This is what makes the split a smooth 0-cochain whose
coboundary is the input cocycle — the heart of "the fine sheaf has no `H¹`". -/
