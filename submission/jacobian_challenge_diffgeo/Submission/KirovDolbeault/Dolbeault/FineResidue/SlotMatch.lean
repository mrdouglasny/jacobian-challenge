# R7c — the `SlotMatchesK` witness: `ω₀`'s chart coefficients match `K = div ω₀`

`DescentVanish.SlotMatchesK 𝔇 g K` demands that at every K-point `a` (where `0 < K a`) and
every cover chart containing it, the `dz`-slot `g j₀` factor as `(ζ − α)^{K a} · u` with `u`
analytic — the slot zero that cancels the `𝒪_K` scalar pole in the product-germ trick.  For
the canonical-form slot `g = omegaCoeff 𝔇 ω₀` with `K = div ω₀` this is *the definition* of
the divisor of a holomorphic form, transported through charts:

* `formOrderW_chart_invariant` reads the form order at `a` as the `meromorphicOrderAt` of the
  chart-`j₀` coefficient at `chartMap 𝔇 j₀ a`;
* `formCoeff_holToSection` identifies that coefficient with `coeffAt α (𝔇.center j₀)
  = omegaCoeff 𝔇 α j₀`;
* the coefficient is **analytic** there (`coeffAt_analyticAt`), so its meromorphic order is its
  analytic order (`AnalyticAt.meromorphicOrderAt_eq`), and the Mathlib factorization
  `AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_eq_natCast` produces exactly the `(ζ − α)^{(K a).toNat} · u` shape
  `SlotMatchesK` asks for (`Int.toNat` collapses nothing since `0 < K a`).

The divisor hypothesis is consumed in the output shape of `exists_form_divisor`
(`CanonicalFormDifferential`): `∀ x, (holToMero α).formOrderW x = (K x : WithTop ℤ)`.

## Main declarations

* `slotMatchesK_omegaCoeff` — **the witness**: `SlotMatchesK 𝔇 (omegaCoeff 𝔇 α) K` whenever
  `K` is the form divisor of `α`.
* `resH1_omegaCoeff` / `cousinResidueData_omegaCoeff` — the unconditional descent and the
  Cousin assembly for the canonical-form slot: every analytic hypothesis of the R-lane descent
  is now discharged for `g = omegaCoeff 𝔇 α`; only `SeparatesPoles` (cover geometry) and
  `CupMLWitnessR` (§17.6 transport) remain.

/-- **The `SlotMatchesK` witness for the canonical-form slot**: if `K` is the form divisor of
the global holomorphic 1-form `α` (the `exists_form_divisor` output shape,
`∀ x, formOrderW x = K x`), then the chart-coefficient family `omegaCoeff 𝔇 α` vanishes to
order `K a` at every K-point in every cover chart containing it — the
`(ζ − α)^{K a} · (analytic)` factorization `DescentVanish` consumes. -/

full analytic side of the R-lane descent is discharged — `IsOneZeroCoeff` by the R4 witness,

(`SeparatesPoles`). -/
