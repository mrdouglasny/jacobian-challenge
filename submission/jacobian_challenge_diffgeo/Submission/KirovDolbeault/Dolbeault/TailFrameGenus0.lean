# The genus-0 arithmetic atom from the meromorphic-frame residue atom (G0 lane)

The G0 atom `hga : 𝔘.h1Dim 0 = 0` at `kirovGenus X = 0` (`docs/planning/G0_BLOCKER.md`)
through the tail tower, reduced to ONE named analytic input.

## The reduction

With both tail towers landed, the pipeline `TailPairFrame X → PairingSurjective →
TailRiemannRoch X → hga` is **genus-free** (`TailPairFrame.pairingSurjective` and
`TailPairFrame.tailRiemannRoch` take no genus hypothesis).  The only genus-dependent link is
frame EXISTENCE: `nonempty_tailPairFrame_of_kirovGenus_pos` (`TailFrameWitness.lean`) builds
the frame from a nonzero HOLOMORPHIC 1-form, which exists only at `kirovGenus X > 0`.

But the frame form's type is already meromorphic: `TailPairFrame.data` is a
`CanonicalForm17Data X` whose `ω₀` is a `MeromorphicOneForm X` — and
`nonempty_canonicalForm17Data` (`CanonicalFormDifferential.lean`) constructs such a datum
UNCONDITIONALLY (`ω₀ = df` of a nonconstant meromorphic `f`, which exists at every genus).
Its slot family is free as well: `slot p := formCoeff ω₀.toFun p` is meromorphic of exact
order `K p` by the datum's own `order_eq`.  So the ONLY missing frame field at genus 0 is the
pair-frame residue theorem `∑ₚ Res_p(F·ω₀) = 0` for a MEROMORPHIC `ω₀` — isolated here as

* `CanonicalForm17Data.ResidueAtom` — the named atom (the exact `resSum` field shape).

It cannot be factored through the proven Gate-A engine
(`SerreResidueTheorem.residueTheorem_unconditional`): a factorization `F·ω₀ = α·g` with `α`
holomorphic would force `div ω₀ ≥ div h` for some global `h` with `ω₀/h` holomorphic, which
is impossible at genus 0 (`deg div ω₀ = −2 < 0`, no nonzero holomorphic forms exist).  The
engine's whole §5 slit tower is parameterized by `coeffAt (α : HolomorphicOneForms X)`
throughout, so the honest discharge is the engine's meromorphic-frame generalization (or the
trace-to-`ℙ¹` of the plain value trace for `ω₀ = df`) — tracked in
`docs/planning/G0_BLOCKER.md`.

## Main declarations

* `CanonicalForm17Data.ResidueAtom` — the single named analytic input: `∑Res(F·ω₀) = 0` over
  `supp(div F) ∪ supp K`, in planar Laurent coefficients, for every meromorphic `F`.
* `TailPairFrame.ofResidueAtom` — the frame from ANY canonical datum + its atom (genus-free).
* `residueAtom_of_form` / `exists_residueAtom_of_kirovGenus_pos` — satisfiability evidence:
  at `kirovGenus X > 0` the atom is a THEOREM (Gate-A through the residue bridge), so the
  named hypothesis is the standard residue theorem, not a placeholder.
* `tailRiemannRoch_of_residueAtom` — `TailRiemannRoch X` from the atom (any genus).
* `h1Dim_zero_eq_zero_of_residueAtom` — **the G0 deliverable**: the `hga` atom
  `𝔘.h1Dim 0 = 0` at `kirovGenus X = 0`, conditional on the residue atom only.
* `exists_serreDualityData_of_genus_zero_of_residueAtom` — the keystone `g = 0` leg under
  the same single input.

/-! ## The named atom -/

/-- **The meromorphic-frame residue atom** (the single remaining analytic input of the G0
lane; `docs/planning/G0_BLOCKER.md` discharge shape 1): for the canonical frame `(ω₀, K)` of
the datum, the planar residue sum of `F·ω₀` vanishes over `supp(div F) ∪ supp K`, for every
global meromorphic `F`.  This is verbatim the `TailPairFrame.resSum` field at the canonical
slot family `slot p = formCoeff ω₀.toFun p`.

Mathematically TRUE on every compact Riemann surface (the residue theorem for meromorphic
1-forms, Forster §17.3 / Miranda Ch. VI); a THEOREM at `kirovGenus X > 0`
(`residueAtom_of_form` below, via Gate A).  At genus 0 it is the open analytic atom: the
Gate-A engine is parameterized by a HOLOMORPHIC `ω₀` and no factorization `F·ω₀ = α·g` with
`α` holomorphic exists at genus 0. -/

        ((chartAt (H := ℂ) p) p) = 0

/-! ## The frame from a datum + its atom (genus-free) -/

/-- **The tail pair frame from a canonical datum and its residue atom.**  The slot family is
the coordinate coefficient `formCoeff ω₀.toFun p` of the datum's (meromorphic) frame form —
meromorphic at the chart centre by the form's own meromorphy, of exact order `K p` by the
datum's `order_eq`.  The residue field is the atom verbatim.  No genus hypothesis. -/

/-! ## Satisfiability evidence: the atom is a THEOREM at positive genus -/

/-- **The residue atom holds for the holomorphic-form datum** (Gate A through the residue
bridge): for a nonzero holomorphic `α`, the datum `canonicalDataOfForm α hα` satisfies its
own residue atom — `resSum_planar` at the support `supp(div F) ∪ supp K`, with
`formCoeff (holToMero α).toFun p = coeffAt α p` definitionally. -/

/-! ## The genus-uniform frame split

Combining the unconditional positive-genus witness (`TailFrameWitness.lean`) with the atom
route: frame existence — hence `TailRiemannRoch X`, hence `h¹(𝒪) = g` at the canonical cover
— needs the residue atom only in the `kirovGenus X = 0` case. -/

/-- **The genus-split frame existence**: a tail pair frame exists given the residue atom in
the genus-0 case only (`kirovGenus X > 0` is covered by the holomorphic-form witness). -/

/-! ## Down-payment toward the atom: exact differentials have zero planar residue

The first brick of every honest discharge route for `ResidueAtom` (`G0_BLOCKER.md`): the
order-`(−1)` planar coefficient of a DERIVATIVE vanishes — locally, `Res(dh) = 0` for any
meromorphic `h` (a Laurent series of the form `∑ aₖ·k·z^{k−1}` has no `z^{−1}` term).
One-variable, proven by the same leading-monomial stripping as the residue bridge. -/
